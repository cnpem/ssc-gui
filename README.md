# Welcome to the Sirius Scientific Computing GUI package!

This package offers a simple structure to use Jupyter Widgets separated in tabs to ease the user experience when going through a processing pipeline.

The purpose of the GUI is to aid user when adjusting parameters to be passed to an image reconstruction algorithm, such as ptychography or tomography. Parameters are saved to a dictionary that can then be easily read by your algorithm of interest.

We hope you can adjust this framework to create your own tabs and make user experience better as well!
